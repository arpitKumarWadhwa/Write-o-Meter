# Write-o-Meter
Small game made in C++ to improve your typing speed

### Description
You are given a small text which you have to type. If you type a character correctly then it is replaced by '*' and if you type it incorrectly a beep sound will be produced. If you take too long to type a character then 1 point from your speed bar will be removed. If your speed bar becomes empty then you lose the game immediately. On completing the game, you are shown a screen which displays your time, number of mistakes and speed(in words per sec).
